Write a function, Unmatch, that returns the element of the slice that does not have a correspondent pair.

If all the number have a correspondent pair, it should return -1.

Expected function
func Unmatch(a []int) int {

}
Usage
Here is a possible program to test your function :

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"piscine"
)

func main() {
	a := []int{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}
	unmatch := piscine.Unmatch(a)
	fmt.Println(unmatch)
}
And its output :

$ go run .
4
$

// notes
1️⃣ What XOR (^) ACTUALLY does

XOR compares bits:

Bit A	Bit B	A ^ B
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0

👉 Same → 0
👉 Different → 1

That’s it.

2️⃣ Three rules (burn these into your brain)

XOR has three killer properties:

Rule 1
x ^ x = 0


A value XORed with itself disappears.

Rule 2
x ^ 0 = x


Zero does nothing.

Rule 3
Order doesn’t matter

a ^ b ^ a = b


This is HUGE.

3️⃣ Walk through YOUR example (slow motion)

Input:

[]int{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}


Binary (simplified):

1 = 001
2 = 010
3 = 011
4 = 100


Now step through the loop:

Start
result = 0

First value: 1
result = 0 ^ 1 = 1

Next: 2
result = 1 ^ 2 = 3

Next: 3
result = 3 ^ 3 = 0   ← they cancel!

Next: 1
result = 0 ^ 1 = 1

Next: 2
result = 1 ^ 2 = 3

Next: 3
result = 3 ^ 3 = 0   ← cancel again

Last: 4
result = 0 ^ 4 = 4

🎯 Final result
4


Every number that appeared twice canceled itself out.

Only the one that appeared once survived.

4️⃣ Why the loop magically works

This line:

result ^= v


means:

result = result ^ v


So result keeps “absorbing” numbers.

Pairs vanish.
The odd one remains.

5️⃣ Why this works ONLY for this problem

XOR works only if:

Every number appears exactly twice

Except one

If a number appears 3 times → ❌ broken
If two numbers appear once → ❌ broken

This is not a counting replacement.
It’s a pair-cancellation trick.

6️⃣ Visual intuition (non-binary)

Think of XOR like toggling a switch:

First time → ON

Second time → OFF

Third time → ON

Even count → OFF
Odd count → ON

The final “ON” value is your answer.

7️⃣ One-line memory trick

XOR removes pairs.
What’s left didn’t have a pair.

That’s it.
