Write a function LoafOfBread() that takes a string and returns another one with words of 5 characters and skips the next character followed by newline \n.

If there is a space in the middle of a string it should ignore it and get the next character until getting to a length of 5.

If the string is less than 5 characters return "Invalid Output\n".

Expected function
func LoafOfBread(str string) string {

}
Usage
Here is a possible program to test your function:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"piscine"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Print(piscine.LoafOfBread("deliciousbread"))
	fmt.Print(piscine.LoafOfBread("This is a loaf of bread"))
	fmt.Print(piscine.LoafOfBread("loaf"))
}
And its output:

$ go run . | cat -e
delic ousbr ad$
Thisi aloaf ofbre d$
Invalid Output$
